# **App Name**: Terra Impact

## Core Features:

- Interactive World Map: Display an interactive 2D world map using React Leaflet where users can click to select an impact location.
- Meteorite Size Input: Allow users to select the size of the meteorite via a slider or text input.
- Impact Simulation: Animate the impact sequence at the selected location, triggered by a button click.
- Impact Animation: Visualize the meteorite's approach (optional), impact flash, shockwave, and temporary crater using 2D animations.
- Feedback Messages: Display short messages to guide the user and provide feedback during simulation.
- Damage assessment: Using generative AI as a tool, estimate effects within a radius of impact of size X, based on pre-existing GIS and geological datasets.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#3498db) to evoke a sense of the planet and impact.
- Background color: Black (#000000) to enhance contrast and focus on the impact animation.
- Accent color: White (#FFFFFF) to highlight interactive elements and the impact zone.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a modern and clear user interface.
- Use minimalist icons for the dashboard controls.
- Employ smooth and visually appealing animations for the meteorite impact sequence, using Framer Motion or React Spring.
